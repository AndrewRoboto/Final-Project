## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
I want to develeope and app that allows the user to place an image on a pair of clothing so I can then creat that clothing. 
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
	For my software I planned on taking advatage of Temple's free creative cloud and use Adobe XD. The idea I have in my head is for the user to load up the app.
and either have a pre-set list of clothing they can chose from or be able to take a pictures of their own clothes and then be able to instert vectored images ontop of the clothing.
From there I will take the vectored images and implament them into a design space and create the clothing design with machines I have at home.
