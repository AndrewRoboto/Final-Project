# Preproposal
APP OR GAME
## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
	My idea is to creat an app that allows users to implment their own designs on blank pairs of clothes.
As a side hobby I like to design clothing. It would cool to have an app where people could present their 
own ideas and I could make them a reality. If this is to far out of reach or out of my ability I would like
to continue with one of the games that are in the modules. I'm mainly look at the mario one for now.
